  <p>Once upon a time, there was a turtle who loved to watch movies; good, bad or mediocre, he would watch any and all of them.

  <p>The most recent movie he watched was <span class="title"></span> which was a <span class="genre"></span>.  Actually, this was a bit unusual for him as he didn't normally like the genre of <span class="genre">s</span> but this one had <span class="actors"></span> all in it together, which was a first!!

  <p>He looked it up on IMDB after and was suprised to see that it had the score of <span class="imdbRating"></span>; he thought that it would be way higher.

  <p>Yesterday, I asked him what it was about.
  <div>

  <p>He said, "<span class="plot"></span> I think you'd really like it!"
